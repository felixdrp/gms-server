# GMS

Glasgow Memories Server (GMS) is a 12 months project, part of an ongoing ESRC funded Urban Big Data Centre (UBDC) project, which archives 12 months publicly available data about the Glasgow city from multiple sources, which includes (but is not limited to):

* online news archives;
* social media posts from Twitter;
* user blogs from Tumblr;
* photographs from image sharing websites such as Flickr, and
* data from wearable sensors like Autographer and GPS devices.

We are piloting with 100 Autographer units to capture lifelogs of user experiences about the Greater Glasgow area on a daily basis for around 12 months. This is a unique multi-modal data set about a city and encodes experiences from multiple user perspectives and has enormous potential in exploiting for public benefit.

It is expected that in the nearby future, digitally active participants will capture personal experiences using lifeloggers and/or with smartphone apps and will share their experience through avenues like GMS.
